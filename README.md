## Data Engineering
A table schema is created for each of the six csv files. The schema can be found in the EmployeeSQL folder > in the file titled [EmployeeSQL.sql](https://github.com/bandaexpress/sql-challenge/blob/main/EmployeeSQL/EmployeeSQL.sql) Specifying:
- Data types, primary keys, foreign keys, and other constraints.

## Data Analysis
Results for the 8 queries regarding the data used in the modeling can be found in the EmployeeSQL folder > in the jupyter notebook titled [EmployeeSQL - Data Analysis.ipynb](https://github.com/bandaexpress/sql-challenge/blob/main/EmployeeSQL/EmployeeSQL%20-%20Data%20Analysis.ipynb)
